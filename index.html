                <h3>I was confused.</h3>
                <p>
                    I'd thought before that while people with disabilities should
                    be treated as equals to non-disabled people, disability itself
                    was overall a negative experience.

                <p class="emphasis-color">
                    But Stella Young saw disability as inherently neutral,
                    and called herself disabled, not "special-needs" or anything
                    like that.

                <ul>
                    <li>People with disabilities should be segregated from others when learning.</li>

            <section class="slide" id="slide-8">
                <h3>However, there are a few key beliefs behind ableism:</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li>People with disabilities have inherently less desirable lives.</li>
                    <li>By extension, <span class="emphasis-color">disability itself is undesirable.</span></li>
                    <li>
                        Coupled with this is the belief that disability
                        <span class="emphasis-color">occurs only on the individual level.</span>
                    </li>

                <h2 class="emphasis-color">These beliefs turn into actions.</h2>
                <ul>
                    <li>Accommodations for the disabled aren't made—ramps, for example.</li>
                    <li>Schools are often segregated by disability and the special-needs classroom.</li>
                    <li>Being dependent is seen as undesirable.</li>
                    <li>People often believe that those who take care of people with disabilities are "saints".</li>
                    <li>Prenatal genetic testing reinforces the belief that a disabled child is a tragedy.</li>
                    <li>Words for disablement are used in a derogatory manner—"lame excuse", "moron", etc.</li>

                    Think of it this way: If society was designed around people who
                    had wings and could fly, and schools were only located in the sky,
                    a nondisabled person in our society couldn't receive an education
                    without outside help.

                <p>
                    Same goes for a person who can't enter buildings because there
                    aren't any ramps, or a person who is removed from class because
                    they can't sit still when learning.

                    <li>
                        Just say the word—"disability" or the specific condition (e.g. autism)
                        instead of "special-needs" or "handicapped".
                        <br>
                        The goal is to remove the stigma from disability.

                    <li>
                        "Nondisabled" over "Normal"—Disability is "normal" for those experiencing it

                    <li>
                        "Uses a wheelchair" over "wheelchair-bound"—"wheelchair-bound" stigmatizes
                        disability by portraying it as a limitation and thus inherently worse.
